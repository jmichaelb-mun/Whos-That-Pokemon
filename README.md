# Whos-That-Pokemon

Are you a Pokemon Master? 

Test your knowledge of Pokemon with this fun and interactive game.

Players will be given the silhouette of a pokemon as well as 4 potential choices. Selecting the correct one will score the user 100 points and load a new randomly generated pokemon.
If the player clicks on the silhouette of the pokemon it will also play the pokemon's cry giving them an extra hint as to what pokemon it is.

To be completed going forward:
- Removing alerts and giving the player a more stylized feedback that keeps the flow of the game smooth
- Playing around with the button to make it more like a PokeBall
- Upon the player reaching score threshold updating the submit button to show a new tier that has been reached. ie: PokeBall from 0-1000, Great Ball from 1000-5000, Ultra Ball from 5000-10000, and Master Ball at anything higher
- Scale scoring based upon consecutive correct answers
- Remove the silhouette upon player getting the answer correct
